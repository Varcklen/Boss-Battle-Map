# Boss-Battle-Map

This is the Boss Battle map source code and extra materials. If you're going to use a map or code from here, be sure to credit the author of the map (Varcklen).

To open the map, you must use TESH. Otherwise, you may problems when opening:

Here you can find 2 folders: Boss Battle Test Ref and Boss Battle Folder.w3x.

[New Way] Boss Battle Folder.w3x - this is the folder with the complete contents of the map. This folder can be opened like a regular map (by File\Open...). To save the map in this format, in the World Editor, select File\Save As... in the "Warcraft 3 Scenario Folder - Expansion" save format.

[Old Way] Boss Battle Test Ref - this is a folder with a version of the map, converted using the W3x2Lni program. This method is outdated and most likely no longer works. To convert the map to .w3x format, use the W3x2Lni program:
