        Const : 'About the map'
        Const : '|c00ffcc00Boss Battle|r is a |c00ffcc00Hero Arena|r map with elements from the |c00ffcc00RougeLike|r genre. Your task is to defeat all the proposed bosses on ten levels. After the victory of the bosses and the transition to the next level, you are given a choice of 3 artifacts that will help you strengthen your character or your allies.

During the battles, you can go to the additional arenas of |c00ffcc00Cute Bob|r for a change and receive additional bonuses. You will lose if all the heroes die in battle with the main bosses (without trying).

There are various shops on the map for selling potions and books, but there are also not ordinary ones: |c00ffcc00Huckster|r will offer you for a small cost to get a random artifact for money or in exchange for another artifact. |c00ffcc00Jules|r - allows you to buy selected artifacts, but at a great price. |c00ffcc00Exchanger|r - allows exchanges between players.

The map adjusts to the number of players, so you can go through the map both alone and with friends up to 4 people.

The map will appeal to players who like |c00ffcc00Hearthstone|r, |c00ffcc00Binding of Isaac|r or, |c00ffcc00Slay the Spire|r.'
